# DehashEZ

Password dehasher using Python. (Part of zDehasher code but extremely optimized)

Support: https://discord.gg/HUgmXaPXSU

# UPDATE
Improvements: 

**Timeout**
- Dehashing timeout set to 120 seconds.

**Optimization in the bruteforce function**
- Dehashing time has been reduced by approximately 30-50 seconds.
- The simplest passwords can be cracked in less than 1 second (Before, in 20).
  
**Optimized wordlist upload**
- Wordlist processing time was reduced by 2-3 seconds.

**Optimized interface**
- Simplified error handling and menu options.
- Total dehashing time is calculated more accurately and presented in a more readable manner.
- The hash result is automatically copied to the clipboard.


# Hash üîí

This program accepts SHA256 and SHA512 hashes, with an optional salt.
So, this includes, AuthMe hashes, DynamicBungeeAuth hashes, etc.

When the program finds the original hash value, it will display it on the screen and automatically copy it to your clipboard.

# Wordlist üìÉ
You must put your wordlist file in the same directory as main.py

If you verified that the wordlist file is in place but the program is unable to detect it, remember that you must write the full name of the file, including the format (For example .txt)

"wordlist" = ‚ùå

"wordlist.txt" = ‚úÖ

If the program still unable to detect the wordlist, verify that you are running the correct main.py in the correct path. 

You can check this in the title of the program window.

If you don't have a wordlist or you can't find any password with yours, join the Discord so we can give you a pretty good one.


# Salt üßÇ

Salt is optional, if the hash you want to decrypt does not have a salt, do not fill in the "SALT" field in the program and simply press enter leaving it empty.
The format of hashes with salt is usually $ALGORITHM$SALT$HASH, so if you want to extract the salt from a hash, you can do it with that format.
